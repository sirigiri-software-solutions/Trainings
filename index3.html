    <h1>puppy</h1>
    <P>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (2.2–3.3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11
        kg (15–24 lb). All puppies display primary altriciality and healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's
        coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
        Puppy refers specifically to young dogs,[1] while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals,
        giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.[2]</P>

    <h6>eskimo dog</h6>
    <P>The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog, originating in Germany. The American Eskimo Dog is a member
        of the Spitz family. The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German sentiment during the
        First World War, it was renamed "American Eskimo Dog." Although modern American Eskimo Dogs have been exported
        as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are
        significantly different. In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also
        achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer.</P>
